📌 README for BMI Tracker and Health Advisor
🤖 Project Overview
BMI Tracker and Health Advisor is a simple web application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs (weight & height). It also provides health advice based on BMI categories and tracks BMI history with an interactive graph.

🎯 Features
✔️ BMI Calculation: Calculates BMI based on weight and height.
✔️ Health Advice: Displays advice based on BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
✔️ BMI Progress Chart: Keeps track of BMI history and visualizes it using an interactive Plotly chart.

📊 How BMI is Calculated?
BMI is calculated using the formula:


BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m)²)
Example:
If weight = 70 kg and height = 1.75 m, then:


BMI = 70 / (1.75 × 1.75) = 22.88 (Normal Weight)
🏥 BMI Categories & Health Advice
BMI Range	Category	Health Advice
< 18.5	Underweight	Try to gain weight with a balanced diet.
18.5 - 24.9	Normal	Maintain a healthy lifestyle.
25 - 29.9	Overweight	Consider a healthy diet and exercise routine.
30+	Obese	Consult a doctor and focus on weight management.
